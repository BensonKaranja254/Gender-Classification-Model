#Gender Classification Model
Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
#Overview:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify gender based on voice data features. The process involved data preprocessing, feature selection, and training various classification algorithms to evaluate performance.

#Key Highlights:

Implemented and compared models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Achieved high accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling.

Visualized data distributions and model results for clear interpretation.

#Outcome:
A robust classification model capable of predicting gender from voice input features with impressive accuracy and generalizability.
