# Gender Classification Model

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify gender based on voice data features. The process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, training various classifiers, and evaluating their performance.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Project Highlights
- Explored and cleaned voice feature dataset for optimal model performance.
- Applied multiple classification algorithms including:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Used feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning to improve results.
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy Score  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Classification Report
- Visualized key performance metrics and data distributions.

## Results
The models demonstrated strong performance in predicting gender from voice features. Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression showed particularly high accuracy, especially after tuning.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of supervised learning for binary classification using real-world voice data. It demonstrates strong foundational skills in data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
